chkschema compares the scheme's of the tables of two databases on the same machine 
or different one. 
Based on the verbosity and severity the output and exit status will be different. 
For some tests this scripts generate the SQLs you need to fix the issue. 
This script gives you suggestions on what are the problems and even SQLs 
to fix them. Currently the fix SQLs available only on some of the tests.

 - missing tables 
 - missing fields
 - missing index 
 - wrong attributes
 - must_exist_field
 - must_exist_pk
 - no-default
 - no-index-but-pk

More tests will be developed in future as needed.

Usage:  php ks-schema-checker.php [Options]
      
Connection:
--------------------------
   -sh   --source-host          Gets the host-name/IP address of the source as an argument.
                              
   -sp   --source-port          Gets the source port address of the source host as an argument (default 3306.)
                              
   -sdb  --source-database      Gets the source database name as an argument. It will be the source of
                          comparison. It will error out if you don't define it.
  
   -sun  --source-username      Gets the source username as an argument. If script can not connect to the 
                          database server it will error out.
                              
   -spwd --source-password      Gets the source password as an argument. If script can not connect to the
                          database server it will error out.
                              
   --target-host          Gets the host-name/IP address of the target as an argument. It you don't
                          define it, source host-name/IP address is the default (default --source-host.)
                              
   --target-port          Gets the target port address of the target host as an argument (default 3306)
                              
   --target-database      Gets the target database username as an argument. If script can not connect
                          to the database server it will error out.
                              
   --target-username      Gets the target username as an argument. If script can not connect to the 
                          database server it will error out.
                              
   --target-password      Gets the target password as an argument. If script can not connect to the
                          database server it will error out.

   -t    --test                 Runs the requested tests only. They have been defined as below;
			  missing-tables   -> The missing table test on target database
			  missing-fields   -> The missing fields on the target tables of target database
			  missing-index    -> The missing indexes on the target tables of the target databases
			  wrong-attributes -> The wrong attrobutes on the target tables of the target databases
			  must-exist-field -> The fields that should exist on the target tables of the target databases
			  must-exist-pk    -> The PK should exist in the target table
			  no-default       -> there should not be any default in the fields of the target table
			  no-index-but-pk  -> There should not be any index but the PK of the source database

   -sf   --sql-fix              Generates the best suggested SQL fixes for the found error, However, this option 
			  is still under test and development. Please use judgment and utilise it carefully.

   -h    --help                 Show the help and exit

   -v    --verbose              Show the result on the screen
  
   -c    --color                Show the result in color. Default is system default text color.

   -el   --error-level          Show the verbosity (error level) of the result. Only problems with defined 
                          error level and above will be reported.

   -fl   --fail-level           By default the fail-level is 3. It means any error-level 3 and above will 
			  cause the standard output to be greater than 0. If you change it to any 
			  other number then if the error-level is equal or greater that number will 
			  cause the fail-level to be set to that number. 
   

Exit Status: 
--------------------------
    0                     If successful. any exist status greater than 0 is failure.
